# sqlalchemy-challenge

This assigment required me to display skills utllizing SQLAlchemy and Python to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate db. 


## The codes for the assignments are in folder path /instructions:

    The climate_starter.ipynb contains the SQLAlchemy. 
        - imported modules: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, datetime,
            sqlalchemy.orm
        
        -SQLite DB name: measurement, station
    
        - Bonus Challenge Assignment completed.
            codes were partially provided in the notebooks. 

    

    app.py contains the Step 2 for the Climate App. Which was used to design a Flask API based on the queries.
        -Flask was used to create the routes. 
        -Routes: 
            - "/" = home 
            - "/api/v1.0/precipitation" = precipitation
            - "/api/v1.0/stations" = station
            - "/api/v1.0/tobs" = temperatures
            -"/api/v1.0/<start>"
            -"/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>" = tmin,tavg,tmax
    
## Modules that needed to imported were already provided in the notebook. 

## Utilized Solutions provided by the instruction to check if I was in the write path when writting my codes.

    Solutions provided by the instructor was used as reference to compile some codes for troubleshooting.
